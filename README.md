# Multimedia Application Project

## Overview
This project aims to collaboratively research, experiment with, and ultimately design and build a multimedia application using design and motion tools as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application implements drag-and-drop functionality to load audio clips and create a dynamic audio experience, trigger animation, and play a compiled audio track.

## Project Workflow
We follow an agile workflow with sprints. Each sprint consists of a scoped mini-project focusing on a particular deliverable or feature. The work is done on a specific branch and merged into the main branch upon completion.

### Sprints Breakdown
#### Sprint 1: Setup, Analysis, and Initial Design
- **Set Up**: Initialize the GitHub repository.
- **Analysis**: Research functionalities and tools.
- **Design**: Create initial layout, HTML, and CSS.
- **Development**: Start JavaScript file creation, set up basic events, and test audio loading.

**Note:** Designers must contribute directly to the repository on their own design branch. Adherence to workflow best practices is mandatory.

#### Sprint 2: Drag and Drop, Audio, Design Improvements
- **Functionality**: Implement drag-and-drop functionality for audio clips.
- **Audio Sync**: Sync audio and ensure playback works correctly.
- **Design**: Replace placeholder assets with final artwork and refine design elements.

#### Sprint 3: Final Touches and Improvements
- **Bug Fixes**: Identify and resolve any remaining bugs.
- **Design Tweaks**: Make final design adjustments.
- **Testing**: Conduct extensive testing for responsiveness and performance on various screen sizes.

## Usage
### Drag and Drop
1. Drag an audio file into the designated drop area.
2. Use the control buttons to play, pause, and stop the audio.

### Controls
- **Play**: Starts audio playback and animations.
- **Pause**: Pauses audio playback and animations.
- **Stop**: Stops audio playback and resets animations.

## Development Setup
### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
